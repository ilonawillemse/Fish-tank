<!-- review van Wesley -->

I added my name to the fish.py document so that the user could see I'm the creator of this code.

Wesley adviced me to add some comments about the working of some mesa lines of code to inform the user about their workings.

he thinks the new_position in my move functions could be written more conveniently.

according to Wesley i can improve my main code by making another function/ method in which i add the lines of code which are inside my main right now and simply call them.

look whether for loops can be written more conveniently
