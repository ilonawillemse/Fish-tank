<!-- Description of project progress -->

week 1:
monday:
- make picture for README proposal
- make the proposal and look into subjects and come up with ideas
- add fish agents to the multigrid
- implement the grid/visgrid with working animation

tuesday:
- change entire implementation to MESA
- make sure fish stay within the fishtank boundaries
- make algea agents
- make fish swim towards the algea in their close by neighborhood

wednesday:
- make sure the fish can eat the algea agents
- adding energy levels, making it possible for the fish to die whenever they run out of energy
- make the algea able to grow, both spread like a fungi as grow randomly because of the light
- looked into inserting a picture of a fish inside the grid


thursday:
- made an option so that the fish can get saturated
- algea will grow by chance
- continued looking into the insertion of a fish picture inside the grid
- fish can mate
- fish can die


friday:
- fish now will float when they die and then disappear.
- keeping track of the number of fish and algea within the tank so a visualisation can be made
- made a visualisation of the number of fish and algea within the tank
- animatie en visualisatie onder elkaar plotten als animatie
- trying to create a balanced ecosystem within the tank


week 2:
monday:
- whenever I try to insert some lightstrength the programm starts working really slow
- random algea growth and neigbouring growth was no succes, now only added one of those two
- added an option so that fish cannot mate when they just did, but removed this option too
- made an option so that the algea have a maximum in growing but removed this too
- removed the saturation function
- had to start over from friday because the program was not functioning anymore as I would have liked

tuesday:
- fish have an age now
- started changing visualisation to mesa advanced
- change current agent aquirement to 'self' instead of doing it the hard way

wednesday:
- fixed some bugs, like having to much agents at a grid point and not only looking whether the first 2 agents are fish to mate
- continued on visualizing the animation with mesa and adding some charts with the fish and algea countings
