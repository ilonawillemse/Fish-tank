<!-- things i like/proud of -->
- I'm  really proud of how my fishtank visualisation turned out and that i was able after all to include the live counting of fish and algea populations in a graph underneath the animation of the fishtank

- I really like how I finally was able to insert images of fish / algea inside my animation

- the floating part of my fish when they die i think is cool too.


<!-- how i cleaned up some parts -->
- I added some methods in order to return the counting of the fish and algea populations at once, this way i did not have to repeat my iterating over the grid for more than once.


<!-- biggest decisions -->
some of the things i wanted to implement in my animation / agent model were: inserting an image of a fish to the grid for visualisation, live tracking of the fish countings and on top of that live viewing this underneath the fishtank visualisation and giving my fish the oppertunity to grow.


- not being able to insert an image inside the animation instead of a square. I tried so much options to insert an image to the animation grid but nothing worked. When I decided to throw out my matplotlib aproach and changed it for the mesa visualisation this problem was fixed. I tried different approaches like some people tried on the internet but they did not work for me. For example, one approach only made my new 'picture' a close up from the real one instead of inserting it in a grid. By chosing for Mesa this implementation became more realistic.

- I tried visualising my fish and algea countings in the same gif but this was somehow very hard. I tried different approaches but everytime I got so close I got stuck and got really frustrated about it. This because I put a lot of effort and time in figuring this out. saving images first and inserting them in a list and then making an animation with matplotlib did not work. whenever i saved the pictures they got a PIL type and this was hard to visualise. I googled a lot but everything I found on the internet did not work for me.

- At first I thought about letting my fish have the oppertunity to grow but this would be cumbersome by using matplotlib. I would have looked at the neighbour pixels and color them the same color but this was not the best way to go so I decided to postpone this implementation and choose to fix my other implementations first. In the end I already choose to switch to Mesa visualisation and by doing that this implementation all of a sudden became way more convenient.


<!-- hard life of having windows 10 -->
- Because I was unable to use plt.show(), the visualisation of the animation was hard since running it in an infinite loop was impossible and it took a long time to run a lot of iterations. I struggled with this problem a long time. I fixed it by choosing the mesa visualisation instead.
